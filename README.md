# sbsigntool 0.6 for OS X
Secure Boot signing tools for OS X.
I created these in order to be able to do UEFI secure boot signing under Mac OS X.
It works also for Appleâ€™s boot.efi but you need to do some extra stripping in order to fix verification.
Installer package for the tools is built and available.
