v0.5:
	sbkeysync's default efivars mountpoint has been moved to
	/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/. This is to match the proposed Linux kernel
	patch for efivarfs, which provides this sysfs node for the purpose of
	mounting efivarfs, and leaving the older ../vars/ interface for legacy
	applications.

	This default can be overridden using the --efivars-path option to
	sbkeysync.

v0.1:
	Initial version
